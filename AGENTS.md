Core principle

Make the project boring and deterministic.
If a human can build/test it with one command, agents will succeed. Otherwise, they will fail unpredictably.

1. Project structure (most important)
    Prefer Swift Package Manager (SPM) for feature code.
    Keep the Xcode app target thin (wiring + assets only).
    If you need Xcode projects, generate them via Tuist or XcodeGen.
    Never rely on manual file adds or target membership.


2. One-command workflows (agents must only call scripts)
    use these scripts as much as possible
        ./scripts/bootstrap – install deps, generate project
        ./scripts/build – deterministic xcodebuild
        ./scripts/test – unit tests (UI tests optional/separate)
        ./scripts/lint – SwiftLint / SwiftFormat


3. Headless, explicit builds
    Always use xcodebuild, never Xcode UI.
    Hard-code scheme, configuration, and simulator destination.
    Example destination: iPhone 15, iOS latest.
    This avoids simulator and scheme ambiguity.


6. Guardrails
    Add small, high-signal unit tests for all new logic.
    Snapshot tests for SwiftUI where regressions matter.
    Commit Package.resolved and pin formatter/linter versions.
